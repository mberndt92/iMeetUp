# iMeetUp
Challenge for #100DaysOfSwiftUI

**Features**
- Add contacts (by choosing an image + assigning a name)
- View all contacts
- View contact detail view
- Remove contact(s)
- Save contacts to documents directory

Kept the ZStack overlay for tech reference & because I like it. Usually not ideal to display the contact name twice in the same view like this.
